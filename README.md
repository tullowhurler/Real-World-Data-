# Real-World-Data-
This repository contains, primarily, a jupyter notebook with an investigation into the concussion data that I used to create my undergraduate thesis as part of my Physiotherapy degree. 

I decided to use my undergraduate thesis as part of the assignment and tried to recreate some random data to replicate my findings. My findings are in the folder marked "Real World Data".

To run the notebook you must have [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) installed on your machine. 

You can install this using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python distribution
