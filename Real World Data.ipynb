    "## Introduction\n",
    "I have decided to base my assigment on a collection of data I gathered for my thesis as part of my Bsc. in Physiotherapy in 2012. For my thesis I investigated the prevalence of concussion in Irish amateur rugby players. On completion of my research my findings were used in various different sports medicine conferences and also featured in a national newspaper at the time. Concern regarding concussion injury in rugby union has grown, due to its potentially dangerous long- term effects on players, but the prevalence is not known. There are strict ‘return to play’ guidelines after concussion, however, it is unclear how compliant players are in regards to these regulations in Ireland. \n",
    "The original study consisted of 114 amatuer players who played with various Leinster junior clubs. Each player filled out a questionnaire designed by myself to investigate how common concussion was, it's symptoms and how much each player knew about concussion. "
